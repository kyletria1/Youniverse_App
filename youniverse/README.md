# Youniverse

“Your own universe. Shine like a star, realize your dreams.”

Youniverse is a gamified productivity app designed to educate, track and motivate users towards realizing their dreams. The narrative of the app is that the user and their new puppy companion Lumen find purpose and drive towards working towards their dream. As they do so, both Lumen and the planet they both inhabit grow and change as each step is taken towards their dream. The user will be able to choose a dream they would like to focus on and then add tasks. As each task is completed they earn experience points which helps Lumen gain levels and Lumen will gradually grow as his levels increase. Once the user has realized their dream, they can say their dream has been realized and then work towards a new goal.

Tracking and completing tasks and goals are not the only way to gain experience points though. Users can also feed Lumen a treat once a day to gain a small amount of experience points. The only other way to gain experience points is to read concise yet informative articles on various topics related to productivity, personal wellbeing and motivation. At the end not only will you gain a small amount of experience points but also have the chance to earn a cosmetic item for Lumen or a decoration for your planet. For example, reading an article on making smart goals will earn you a pair of glasses while reading an article on the benefits of working out will earn you a pair of dumbbells. This gives users the incentive to educate themselves on various beneficial topics while on the app but not all articles will give a reward at the end but users can read more than one article a day (though the reward you get is only earned on the first time the article is finished being read).

Users can have Lumen wear various different hats, clothing and accessories and have up to three decorations placed on their planet (each spot for a decoration is earned by leveling up Lumen starting with only one spot when starting the app). Users can even tap Lumen and he will say a cute motivational message to the user encouraging them to keep chasing their dreams. The hope is that with Lumen and Youniverse’s help, people may be able to more easily track their long time goals, educate themselves on how to be more productive and stay motivated to keep holding on towards their dreams.

# Next.js Guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
